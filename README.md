# Household Technology Distribution Analysis by District

This project examines the distribution and relationships between various technological devices in households across different districts, based on data sourced from the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Open Data Portal. Key steps include:

## Data Import and Exploration:

Imported data from an Excel file containing district-level information on technological device counts.
Explored dataset dimensions and generated statistical summaries for key variables.
## Correlation and Regression Analysis:

Conducted linear regression analysis to examine relationships between desktop and laptop counts, revealing a strong positive correlation (r = 0.67).
Evaluated the significance of relationships using F-tests.
## Missing Data Simulation and Handling:

Simulated missing data by randomly removing 10% of the values in numeric columns.
Visualized missing data patterns using tools like Amelia, naniar, and VIM.
Imputed missing values using mean substitution and confirmed successful handling.
## Data Visualization:

Generated scatter plots to depict relationships between desktops and laptops across households.
Used advanced visualization techniques to highlight missing data and post-imputation completeness.
